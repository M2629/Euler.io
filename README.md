High Yield Farming for sustainable passive income

Abstract  
Euler.io is a simple yield   farming   designed   to   benefit   passive income earners
for   the   long   term.   It   introduces   “Infinites”   for   stakers   and   liquidity   providers   to   earn   rewards   and  
increase   their   holdings   while   participating   in   network   growth.  
 
Our   Euler   (E)   token   has   a   total   supply   of   100 million.   Since   no   presale   or   team   fund   was  
created,   there   will   be   no   circulating   Euler   at   launch.   Instead,   a   reward   allocation   will   begin   at  
50 million   tokens   and   halve   every   2   weeks   until   a   total   of   100 million   Euler   has   been   distributed   to  
liquidity   Infinities   and   Infinite   chasers.   The   reward   allocation   will   be   split   up   amongst   the   Infinites  
according   to   the   percentages   described   in   each   Infinite   below.  
 
Infinity   Finance   is   rugproof   with   no   presale   or   team   fund.   We   will   launch   with   two   Infinites  
available   for   chasing:  "Parabolic"    and   "Exponeniality".   We   will   prepare   a   third   Infinite  
called     "Log"    with   a   pair   based   on   community   governance   voting.
